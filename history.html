                    <li>The actual time and place of the origin of cheese and cheesemaking is unknown. The practice is closely related to the domestication of milk producing animals. The art of cheesemaking is referred to in ancient Greek mythology and evidence of cheese and cheesemaking has been found on Egyptian tomb murals dating back over 4000 years.</li>
                    <li>Romans introduced cheesmaking to England. During the Middle Ages-from the decline of the Roman Empire until the discovery of Amarica-cheese was made and improved by the monks in the monasteries of Europe.</li>
                    <li>Cheesemaking continued to flourish in Europe and became an established food. THe making of cheese quicly spread in the New World, but until the 19th century it remained a local farm industry. It wasn't until 1851 that the first cheese factory in the United States was built by Jesse Williams in New York.</li>
                    <li>As population across the United States continued to grow dramatically, the demand for cheese increased and the industry gradually moved westward, centering on the rich farm lands of Wisconsin.</li>
                    <li>In 1845, a band of Swiss immigrants settled in Green County, Wisconsin and started the manufacturing of foreign cheese in Amarica.</li>
                    <li>The wholesale cheese industry was born and showed phenomenal growth during the latter half of the 1800s. However, chesse demand continued to grow and spread rapidly, manufactured and processed cheese production increased dramatically.</li>
                    <li>Processed cheese also experienced a surge uin consumer demand with annual production exceeding 2 billion pounds a year by the beginning of the 1990s.</li>
                    <li>Currently, more than one-third of all milk produced each year in the U.S. is used to manufacture cheese.</li>
                    <li>Recent increases in the overall demand for farm milk have in large part been due to the continued growth of the cheese industry.</li>
                    <li>As consumer appetites for all types of cheese continue to expand, so will the industry.</li>
